# If you don't feel like worrying about this part, you can just use the one jump
# frame as a placeholder and after I close out the visual-assets branch, I can 
# handle tuning the animations.

# For the jump animation, you can use frame 0 from the crouch folder as the first 
# frame, followed by frames 0 and 1 from the jump folder. It may be necessary to have a 
# separate animation for the windup to the crouch and another one for the 
# sustained part of the jump.
